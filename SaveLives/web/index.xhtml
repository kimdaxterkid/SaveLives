                        <p>Wikipedia reports that “The city of Baltimore, Maryland, United States is infamous for its very high crime rate, 
                            including a violent crime rate that ranks high above the national average.”</p> 
                        <i class="h3Title">Baltimore Murder Rate Still Rising</i>
                        <p>In an article entitled “After 
                            Bloodiest Year, Baltimore Murder Rate Still Rising”, Huston indicates that “With 344 murders, last year was the 
                            bloodiest year in the City of Baltimore’s history. But as 2016 reaches its halfway point, the bloodshed seems to 
                            be showing no signs of stopping.” [Huston 2016]. </p>

                        <i class="h3Title">The law enforcement officers need help</i>
                        <p>One approach to help the Baltimore City Police Department to prevent crimes is to provide them with crime data 
                            analytics and mapping so that they are better prepared about what, where, and when to expect occurrences of 
                            illegal activities and crimes. In an article entitled “Predicting Crime Using Analytics and Big Data”, Collins 
                            indicates that “A unique approach to crime analysis may allow police officers to predict illegal activity.” 
                            [Collins 2013]</p>
                        <i class="h3Title">A possible solution</i>
                        <p>As a solution to the stated problem, the Baltimore City Police Department would like to have a multi-tiered 
                            distributed cloud software system to be able to track crimes in order to support increased police support 
                            during peak crimes and locations as needed. By looking at trends and anomalies, the law enforcement officers 
                            can better understand the nuances of crime and better support the city.</p>

                        <p>The Baltimore City Police Department already provides victim-based crime data.</p>

                        <p>This data can be ingested into persistent storage using MongoDB database. MongoDB is a free and open-source 
                            cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database management system. Once the data is stored in a MongoDB, it 
                            can be injested using RESTful API called SODA (Socrata Open Data API) </p>
                        <i class="h3Title">Future of this application</i>
                        <p>The desired cloud software system can be reused by many stakeholders including other city police departments, 
                            FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security by using other collected crime datasets.</p>
